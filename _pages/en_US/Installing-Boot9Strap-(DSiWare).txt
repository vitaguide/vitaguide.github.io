There are two different methods of installing boot9strap using DSiWare on 11.4.0.
{: .notice--info}

One of these methods only works with four specific games that are no longer sold on the eShop, while the other works with quite a few games still sold on the eShop.
{: .notice--info}

Both of these methods require two devices. One 3DS (or 2DS) must be running some kind of custom firmware (such as boot9strap or arm9loaderhax) and is referred to as the *source 3DS*, while the other 3DS (or 2DS) is on stock 11.4.0 and referred to as the *target 3DS*.
{: .notice--info}

Both systems MUST be from the same region.
{: .notice--warning}

Both of these methods will assume that the 3DS running custom firmware is using boot9strap or arm9loaderhax and has completed this guide. While it is possible to do these methods with some other kind of custom firmware, that is out of the scope of this guide.
{: .notice--info}

Both of these methods use a combination of the "FIRM partitions known-plaintext" exploit detailed [here](https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/3DS_System_Flaws), and an oversight that allows DSiWare titles to read and write to anywhere in encrypted NAND.
{: .notice--info}

Both of these methods require you to [System Transfer](http://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/13996/) from a CFW 3DS to a stock 3DS as part of the steps. System Transfers will work in the following directions *only*:    
  + New 3DS -> New 3DS    
  + Old 3DS or 2DS -> Old 3DS or 2DS    
  + Old 3DS or 2DS -> New 3DS    
{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--warning">{{ notice-4 | markdownify }}</div>

In both of these methods, the source 3DS's NNID will be stuck on the target 3DS unless you either system transfer back or call Nintendo! (details can be found in the instructions)
{: .notice--danger}

System Transfers can only be performed once a week per NNID.
