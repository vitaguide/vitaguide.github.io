If you have already hacked your device before and have a EmuNAND based CFW setup, this guide deals exclusively with SysNAND and you should follow all instructions from within or applying to SysNAND. Note that the terms EmuNAND and RedNAND refer to slightly different implementations of [the same concept](http://3dbrew.org/wiki/NAND_Redirection).

##### Section II - Launching SafeB9SInstaller

1. Launch udsploit from the list of homebrew
  + You may have to scroll down to see this option

  + This may take several tries
  + If it freezes, just force the console to power off by holding the power button, then try again
1. Launch safehax from the list of homebrew
  + You may have to scroll down to see this option
  + If you get a "PM INIT FAILED" error, make sure you ran udsploit with Wireless Communication turned on
  + If you *still* get a "PM INIT FAILED" error, try using the [r19 release of safehax](https://github.com/TiniVi/safehax/releases/tag/r19)
  + If it freezes, just force the console to power off by holding the power button, then try again
1. If the exploit was successful, you will have booted into SafeB9SInstaller

##### Section III - Installing boot9strap

1. Wait for all safety checks to complete
1. When prompted, input the key combo given to install boot9strap
1. Once it has completed, press (A) to reboot your device
1. Your device will boot into boot9strap, then shutdown automatically because it does not yet have a payload to launch
  + Your device will not boot until you continue with the next page's instructions; do not panic, this is normal
