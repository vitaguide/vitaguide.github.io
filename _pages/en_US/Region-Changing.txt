This is add-on section for region changing your CFW SysNAND. This is done by installing the 9.2.0 CTRTransfer image for the region you want to switch to.
{: .notice--primary}

**Region changing is almost completely unnecessary since Luma3DS supports out of region games and individual [title region emulation](https://github.com/AuroraWright/Luma3DS/wiki/Options-and-usage).**
{: .notice--info}

To use the [magnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_URI_scheme) links on this page, you will need a torrent client like [Deluge](http://dev.deluge-torrent.org/wiki/Download)
{: .notice--success}

Note that, on some versions of Luma3DS, the Luma3DS chainloader menu is only displayed if there is more than one payload detected. If there is only one payload detected, holding (Start) on boot will directly launch GodMode9.
{: .notice--info}

This process will unlink your NNID from the system, since it will no longer be compatible with it. NNID's are locked to the region of your device that created them, and cannot be transferred between regions without [a very complex and advanced process](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/yifanlu/e80db121d38aceb8cca0e03cefd5853b/raw/3c4dd89869156ca0f945a2791e699acfdb32b510/gistfile1.txt).
{: .notice--warning}

After this process, only **New 3DSs which have never accessed the eShop before** and **any Old 3DSs** will be able to access the eShop after creating a new NNID on their new region. Region changed New 3DSs that have already accessed the eShop on their original region cannot create a new NNID and access the eShop on their new region!
{: .notice--warning}

Note that occasionally the eShop will inexplicably still not work for devices that it should work for. This is entirely to do with Nintendo's servers, and I really do not have any control over it.
{: .notice--warning}

Similar to the above warning, note that occasionally the eShop will inexplicably work for devices that it should not (such as some New 3DSs). The cause for this is currently unknown.
{: .notice--warning}

Region changing using CTRTransfer (which this method uses) seems to cause reboot patches to break. The cause for this is unknown, but for now Old 3DS users will be unable to play extended memory mode games (such as Monster Hunter, Super Smash Bros, and Pok√©mon Sun / Moon) until they format their devices.
{: .notice--warning}

**You MUST have already installed Luma3DS and boot9strap or arm9loaderhax to use this.**
{: .notice--danger}
