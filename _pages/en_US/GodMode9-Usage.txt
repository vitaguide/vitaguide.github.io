GodMode9 is a full access file browser for the Nintendo 3DS console, giving you access to your SD card, to the FAT partitions inside your SysNAND and EmuNAND and to basically anything else. Among other functionality, you can copy, delete, rename files and create folders.
{: .notice--primary}

Note that, on some versions of Luma3DS, the Luma3DS chainloader menu is only displayed if there is more than one payload detected. If there is only one payload detected, holding (Start) on boot will directly launch GodMode9.

{% capture notice %}
This is powerful stuff, it provides you with the means to do basically any thinkable modification to any system data available on the 3DS console. However, precautions are taken so you don't accidentally damage the data of your console.
<br><br>
The write permissions system protects you by providing warnings and forces you to enter an unlock sequence for enabling write permissions. It is not possible to overwrite or modify any important stuff without such unlock sequences and it is not possible to accidentally unlock something. As always, be smart, keep backups, just to be safe.
