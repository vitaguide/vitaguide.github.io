## <a name="gw_fbi" />Cannot inject H&S on Gateway downgraded device
This is caused by Gateway implementing a very shoddy downgrade method, which leaves two versions of each app on the system. One of them is unused, but it confuses the H&S inject system, causing it to inject into the wrong one.

Note that, on some versions of Luma3DS, the Luma3DS chainloader menu is only displayed if there is more than one payload detected. If there is only one payload detected, holding (Start) on boot will directly launch GodMode9.
{: .notice--info}

1. Boot your device while holding (Start) to launch the Luma3DS chainloader menu
1. Launch GodMode9 by pressing (A)   
1. Navigate to `[1:] SYSNAND CTRNAND` -> `title` -> `00040010`

1. Notice that there are two sets of app and tmd files, one set with uppercase extensions (`.TMD` and `.APP`), and one set with lowercase extensions (`.tmd` and `.app`)
1. While holding the (R) trigger, press (Y) to create a new directory
1. Press (A) to confirm the name `newdir` (it does not matter what the folder is called)
1. Press (A) to unlock SysNAND (lvl1) writing, then input the key combo given
1. Press the (L) trigger on each of the uppercase extension files (`.TMD` and `.APP`) to mark them
1. Press (Y) to copy the files
1. Navigate to `newdir`
1. Press (Y) to paste the files
1. Select "Move path(s)"
