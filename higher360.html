If you want to hack your PS Vita 3.61 or above, please stay tuned. There is no publicly known way to hack your PS Vita 3.61 at this point.<br>

It is unlikely a hack will be released for firmware 3.61 anytime soon (it took 5 years for the 3.60 hack to be released), the recommendation for now is toÂ buy a PS Vita running firmware 3.60 or lower.<sup>1</sup>
